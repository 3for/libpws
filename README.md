# libpws #

A library for interpreting PWS (prover worksheet) files, which we use
to describe arithmetic circuits.

This code is ported from [Zebra](https://github.com/pepper-project/zebra/).
I've traded the dependency on libchacha for a dependency on libcrypto,
rewritten the build system, and done other cleanup.

## Building ##

On debian-ish systems, you'll probably need the following:

    apt-get install build-essential g++ automake pkg-config \
                    libssl-dev libtool libtool-bin libgmp-dev

The above should translate straightforwardly to other package managers: you'll
need a C++11-compatible compiler (I've tested with g++ 5, 6, and 7), automake,
pkg-config, libtool, and development headers for OpenSSL.
(If you can't figure out what packages you need to install, please contact me!)

Next, to build the software:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make -j4        # for example
